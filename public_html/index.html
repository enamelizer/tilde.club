        <h2>~ about me ~</h2>
        <p>i am a software engineer in seattle, one of my first coding projects was making a geocities personal site
           and I am coming full circle with tilde.club</br>
           one of my goals is to create something everyday, you can see my progress on
           <a href="http://tilde.club/~enamel/blog/">my blog</a> it even has an
           <a href="http://tilde.club/~enamel/blog/feed.rss">rss feed! wow!</a>

                    <p>This site that you are looking at right now was created by hand in a terminal. One of my first coding projects
                       was a geocities homepage, and this page hopes to capture the wonderful jank of the era of personal web sites.

                    <h3>uncle</h3>
                    <img class="resize center" src="images/uncle.png">
                    <p>UNCLE is a bad game no one wanted about a clown who gives away bad games no one wants. It was created in the
                       fantasy console PICO-8.</p>

                    <h3>dr2rallymaster</h3>
                    <img class="resize center" src="images/DR2Rallymaster.png">
                    <p>DR2Rallymaster is the next version of DRLeagueParser but for Dirt Rally 2.0. A big focus of this version was
                       to work with the changes made to the Racenet Clubs API. While the API was much improved and easier to parse,
                       it was completely different and parts of it were behind authentication. This required a system to display
                       the Codemasters login page and use the authentication tokens in the API calls, which was a challenge.</p>
                    <p>Another goal of mine was to make the visual style as much like a UWP / "metro" app as posible, with a flat
                       visual design. I also included the ability to have dark and light themes with changable accent colors.
                       I found the flat design to be somewhat challenging as it is not immediately apparent that you can
                       interact with some of the elements using a flat visual design.</p>

                    <h3>wavetoy</h3>
                    <img class="resize center" src="images/wavetoy.png">
                    <p>Wavetoy is a small software toy for generating, mixing, displaying, and playing audio waveforms. Mostly a
                       personal exploration into digital sound synthesis, but also seeing how closely I could get a WPF app to
                       visually mimic a UWP or "metro" app while still staying in the Win32 space.

                    <h3>drleagueparser</h3>
                    <img class="resize center" src="images/DRLeagueParser.png">
                    <p>DRLeagueParser is a tool for exporting results for Dirt Rally leagues to CSV. It initally started for the need
                       to get individual stage times from rallies, which is not available on the Dirt Rally website. The first version
                       allowed the user to copy and paste the results from the Dirt Rally league site into the tool and crunch the
                       numbers for stage times. I then extended it to pull the results directly from the Dirt Rally API so the copy
                       paste step was no longer needed. Finally I added an ELO system in order to rank drivers in a league and separate
                       them into subdivisions based on skill.</p>

                    <img class="resize center" src="images/haystack.png">
                    <p>Haystack is a Kerbal Space Program mod that allows the player to quickly select ships from a menu
                       instead of searching for them on the map or using the spce center. Most of the work was completed by another
                       developer, I took over development of it, updating it to the then-current version of KSP and extending it
                       with more functionality.</p>
