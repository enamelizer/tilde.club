<p>Intertia is a powerful force regardless if you are at rest or in motion. So let's get back into motion, shall we?</p>

<p>I made this for an art contest, real low effort style, taking some art I already made and sticking a top hat on it.
   But hey, I did a thing.</p>

<p>In the itch.io racial justice bundle I came across an app named <a href="https://arudson.itch.io/drum-brain">Drum Brain</a>.
   It allows you to use a Rockband drum set to create drum loops. It is pretty cool on it's own, but then I realized you can
   load in your own samples, and since I am a terrible drummer I also was very happy to see a quantize function in there.</p>

<p>So I loaded up a bunch of 808 samples and made a nice little loop. Really fun to play around with, basically using a e-drum
   set instead of a sequencer. Here is the sequence and the output.</p>

<p>Livestreamed a tidal cycles improv session, was not really feeling it and it was sort of going nowhere and then it just came together
   all of the sudden. Ended up liking the outcome quite a bit, and it sort of surprised me.</p>

<p>I did a ton of work today and was totally wiped out by the time I had some free time. I wanted to get something in so I did a
   lesson in tidal cycles about randomness. I didn't really create anything on my own aside from typing along with the lesson,
   and I am not sure how I can work in randomness into my work with tidal cycles, that is for another day.</p>

<p>Yesterday's everyday was something a little different, and closer to what I do professionally. It was a very hot day and I wanted to
   see if I could keep the temperature inside my house cooler than outside and if so, by how much. My theory went something like this:
   first, draw in as much cool air overnight, then in the morning shut the windows and blinds (to reduce the solar load) and log
   indoor and outdoor temperatures over the day.</p>

<p>When I started logging data I had a pretty close correlation between the indoor and outdoor temps. As the outdoor temps started to
   rise, the indoor temp rose at a much higher rate. I am patting myself on the back at this point. However as I don't have air
   conditioning, I was expecting the indoor temp to track closer to the outdoor temp but I found the indoor temp to stay quite a bit
   lower than I was expecting.</p>

<p>Around 5pm I was measuring a 10 degree temperature difference, but I was pretty sceptical that I was measuring indoor temp
   accurately. I stepped outside and couldn't tell a huge difference. So I decided I would open the windows and turn the fans on and
   equalize the temperatures. After two hours I was not seeing the equalization I was expecting.</p>

<p>This data simply left me questioning my measuring devices. I was using my thermostat for indoor temp and pulling outdoor temp off
   the internet. I would love to repeat this experiment with more accurate and SELF LOGGING equipment. I also want to measure humidity
   as higher humidity in the house could have made the temperature difference feel lower.</p>

<p>Here is a table of data I don't trust:</p>

<p>I finally missed a day :(</p>

<p>But before I did I played around with an app named <a href="https://arudson.itch.io/drum-brain">Drum Brain</a>. It allows you to
   use a Rockband drum set to fire drum samples like a midi drum set. It was really fun and I put down an really nice drum loop
   that I really liked, but didn't actually record the thing thinking I would come back to it (and never did).</p>

<p>Nearly didn't everyday today, but ended up with a very late night tidal cycles session trying to wrap my head around
chop / striate / slice / splice. Didn't get very far but did make some cool feedback loops with the delay effect.</p>
