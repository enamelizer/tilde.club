<p>Yesterday's everyday was something a little different, and closer to what I do professionally. It was a very hot day and I wanted to
   see if I could keep the temperature inside my house cooler than outside and if so, by how much. My theory went something like this:
   first, draw in as much cool air overnight, then in the morning shut the windows and blinds (to reduce the solar load) and log
   indoor and outdoor temperatures over the day.</p>

<p>When I started logging data I had a pretty close correlation between the indoor and outdoor temps. As the outdoor temps started to
   rise, the indoor temp rose at a much higher rate. I am patting myself on the back at this point. However as I don't have air
   conditioning, I was expecting the indoor temp to track closer to the outdoor temp but I found the indoor temp to stay quite a bit
   lower than I was expecting.</p>

<p>Around 5pm I was measuring a 10 degree temperature difference, but I was pretty sceptical that I was measuring indoor temp
   accurately. I stepped outside and couldn't tell a huge difference. So I decided I would open the windows and turn the fans on and
   equalize the temperatures. After two hours I was not seeing the equalization I was expecting.</p>

<p>This data simply left me questioning my measuring devices. I was using my thermostat for indoor temp and pulling outdoor temp off
   the internet. I would love to repeat this experiment with more accurate and SELF LOGGING equipment. I also want to measure humidity
   as higher humidity in the house could have made the temperature difference feel lower.</p>

<p>Here is a table of data I don't trust:</p>

<p>I finally missed a day :(</p>

<p>But before I did I played around with an app named <a href="https://arudson.itch.io/drum-brain">Drum Brain</a>. It allows you to
   use a Rockband drum set to fire drum samples like a midi drum set. It was really fun and I put down an really nice drum loop
   that I really liked, but didn't actually record the thing thinking I would come back to it (and never did).</p>

<p>Nearly didn't everyday today, but ended up with a very late night tidal cycles session trying to wrap my head around
chop / striate / slice / splice. Didn't get very far but did make some cool feedback loops with the delay effect.</p>

<p>Created a new avatar for posting on stuff and things. It was a long overdue change! It was created in the sprite editor in
   PICO-8.</p>

<p>Finished the music projects section of <a href="https://tilde.club/~enamel/blog/index.html">my homepage</a> which completes
   the bulk of what I originally intended to do with my tilde page. I have come up with some new ideas for some new pages, and
   I will probably continue to tweak it, I have come to hate the color. Which makes sense as I tried to pick a really awful
   color scheme for it.</p>

<p>I feel like I am starting to get into a groove with everydays, I am now trying to get them wrapped up by midnight to make sure I
   don't spend too much time working into the wee hours of the morning. We will see how my motivation goes as things get a little
   more free form and I don't have a set list of items I am trying to tick off.</p>

<p>I want to dive back into live coding with Tidal Cycles, and I may try to push an update to UNCLE. Not really sure what comes next
   maybe more HTML hacking!</p>

<p>Planned on filling out the music section of my homepage, but some of the stuff I did on twitch didn't want to embed. Ended up being
   a bit of a time sink. I figured it out, but by then I was aleady invested and moving it to youtube to host.</p>

<p>So a fair amount of time invested all I have have to show for it is <a href="http://tilde.club/~enamel/blog/algorhythms.html">a

<p>"Live coding" in the general sense is creating art using code, usually on the fly in an improvisational way.</p>

<p>I have been playing around with music production using a patterning language <a href="https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome">
   Tidal Cycles</a>, where you can create patterns and sequences of samples and synths among other things.</p>

<p>Here are a few of my explorations using it</p>

   as well as some CSS to at least de-jank it a little bit. It grew so much with hashtag content! Here is what it looks like now:</p>
