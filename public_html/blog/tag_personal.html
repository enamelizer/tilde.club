<p>I have been thinking of self-hosting a personal site for some time and after a discussion with a friend about getting people together to write silly geocities style web pages, the internet lead me to tilde.club where people were doing just that. I figured doing it as a part of a community effort would be more fun / interesting than going it on my own, so here I am.</p>

<p>In the past I have tried and failed to blog as a part of a professional portfolio, which went nowhere. This time I plan on keeping it light and about personal projects, and keeping posts short.</p>

<p><b>A bit about me.</b> I am a professional software developer in Seattle that specializes in Windows desktop apps. I have been trying to make an effort to explore new technologies (like pubnix) and just generally create more for personal fulfillment. I will post more about the things I have done as I create my homepage, but I generally work on tools, and have been playing around with making music and recently made my first (very very small) game.</p>
