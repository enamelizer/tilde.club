<p>Yesterday's everyday was something a little different, and closer to what I do professionally. It was a very hot day and I wanted to
   see if I could keep the temperature inside my house cooler than outside and if so, by how much. My theory went something like this:
   first, draw in as much cool air overnight, then in the morning shut the windows and blinds (to reduce the solar load) and log
   indoor and outdoor temperatures over the day.</p>

<p>When I started logging data I had a pretty close correlation between the indoor and outdoor temps. As the outdoor temps started to
   rise, the indoor temp rose at a much higher rate. I am patting myself on the back at this point. However as I don't have air
   conditioning, I was expecting the indoor temp to track closer to the outdoor temp but I found the indoor temp to stay quite a bit
   lower than I was expecting.</p>

<p>Around 5pm I was measuring a 10 degree temperature difference, but I was pretty sceptical that I was measuring indoor temp
   accurately. I stepped outside and couldn't tell a huge difference. So I decided I would open the windows and turn the fans on and
   equalize the temperatures. After two hours I was not seeing the equalization I was expecting.</p>

<p>This data simply left me questioning my measuring devices. I was using my thermostat for indoor temp and pulling outdoor temp off
   the internet. I would love to repeat this experiment with more accurate and SELF LOGGING equipment. I also want to measure humidity
   as higher humidity in the house could have made the temperature difference feel lower.</p>

<p>Here is a table of data I don't trust:</p>
