<p>Tutorial #3 was on the voltage controlled filter. I also was playing around with controlling the knobs with my
new midi controller, the Arturia Minilab MkII. Not too happy with the outcome here, but made a video to document it
nonetheless.</p>

<p>Continuing on Omri Cohen's beginner patches series, this one focuses on using an LFO to modulate the pulse width
of a square wave and mangling the envelope generator. I also learned a valuable lesson about making sure your
envelope is actually attenuating your signal.</p>

<p>In the itch.io racial justice bundle I came across an app named <a href="https://arudson.itch.io/drum-brain">Drum Brain</a>.
   It allows you to use a Rockband drum set to create drum loops. It is pretty cool on it's own, but then I realized you can
   load in your own samples, and since I am a terrible drummer I also was very happy to see a quantize function in there.</p>

<p>So I loaded up a bunch of 808 samples and made a nice little loop. Really fun to play around with, basically using a e-drum
   set instead of a sequencer. Here is the sequence and the output.</p>

<p>I did a ton of work today and was totally wiped out by the time I had some free time. I wanted to get something in so I did a
   lesson in tidal cycles about randomness. I didn't really create anything on my own aside from typing along with the lesson,
   and I am not sure how I can work in randomness into my work with tidal cycles, that is for another day.</p>

</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Yesterday's everyday was something a little different, and closer to what I do professionally. It was a very hot day and I wanted to
   see if I could keep the temperature inside my house cooler than outside and if so, by how much. My theory went something like this:
   first, draw in as much cool air overnight, then in the morning shut the windows and blinds (to reduce the solar load) and log
   indoor and outdoor temperatures over the day.</p>

<p>When I started logging data I had a pretty close correlation between the indoor and outdoor temps. As the outdoor temps started to
   rise, the indoor temp rose at a much higher rate. I am patting myself on the back at this point. However as I don't have air
   conditioning, I was expecting the indoor temp to track closer to the outdoor temp but I found the indoor temp to stay quite a bit
   lower than I was expecting.</p>

<p>Around 5pm I was measuring a 10 degree temperature difference, but I was pretty sceptical that I was measuring indoor temp
   accurately. I stepped outside and couldn't tell a huge difference. So I decided I would open the windows and turn the fans on and
   equalize the temperatures. After two hours I was not seeing the equalization I was expecting.</p>

<p>This data simply left me questioning my measuring devices. I was using my thermostat for indoor temp and pulling outdoor temp off
   the internet. I would love to repeat this experiment with more accurate and SELF LOGGING equipment. I also want to measure humidity
   as higher humidity in the house could have made the temperature difference feel lower.</p>

<p>Here is a table of data I don't trust:</p>

<p>I finally missed a day :(</p>

<p>But before I did I played around with an app named <a href="https://arudson.itch.io/drum-brain">Drum Brain</a>. It allows you to
   use a Rockband drum set to fire drum samples like a midi drum set. It was really fun and I put down an really nice drum loop
   that I really liked, but didn't actually record the thing thinking I would come back to it (and never did).</p>

</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Finished the music projects section of <a href="https://tilde.club/~enamel/blog/index.html">my homepage</a> which completes
   the bulk of what I originally intended to do with my tilde page. I have come up with some new ideas for some new pages, and
   I will probably continue to tweak it, I have come to hate the color. Which makes sense as I tried to pick a really awful
   color scheme for it.</p>

<p>I feel like I am starting to get into a groove with everydays, I am now trying to get them wrapped up by midnight to make sure I
   don't spend too much time working into the wee hours of the morning. We will see how my motivation goes as things get a little
   more free form and I don't have a set list of items I am trying to tick off.</p>

<p>I want to dive back into live coding with Tidal Cycles, and I may try to push an update to UNCLE. Not really sure what comes next
   maybe more HTML hacking!</p>

<p>"Live coding" in the general sense is creating art using code, usually on the fly in an improvisational way.</p>

<p>I have been playing around with music production using a patterning language <a href="https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome">
   Tidal Cycles</a>, where you can create patterns and sequences of samples and synths among other things.</p>

<p>Here are a few of my explorations using it</p>

<p>I downloaded some period correct gifs to make my <a href="http://tilde.club/~enamel/">homepage</a> really pop. I am nearly 100% sure I found the same CD gif I had on
   my geocities page in the 90s. Anyway, now my <a href="http://tilde.club/~enamel/">homepage</a> looks like this:</p>

everydays 5
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Tried to find something quick to update, still ended up spending an hour fiddling with the CSS on this blog.
   I largely followed (aped) the design guidelines at 
   <a href="https://www.material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html">google's material dark theme</a>.
</p>
<p>I also reformatted the main css file, and when doing so realized I was un-minifying it and making the file
   size larger for my own feelings of vanity. Going to look into a script to take my pretty format and minify it
   to reduce the file size. If you are going for small static HTML, might as well go all the way right?
<p>
<p>streak: 5</p>

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(75.00% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/SpottedAgedChrysalis' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

everydays
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>A concept that has stuck in my mind recently is the concept of "everydays" where one commits to an act of creation every day. I came across this idea from the visual artist <a href="https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays">beeple</a>, who as of this writing has completed 4824 consecutive days of creating a piece from scratch every day. Another form is "100 Days of Code" which is a challenge to complete 100 days of coding without missing two consecutive days.</p>

<p>The rules for people's everydays differ, but the main goal is skill building, and committing to this publically provides accountability. In beeple's case his rules are to create something, <b>anything</b> no matter if it is 5 minutes or 5 hours of work, as long as it is submitted to the internet before midnight. For 100 Days of Code their rules are an hour of coding before you go to sleep that night, and missing a day is ok.</p>

<p>My goal for everydays primarily skill building and working on personal interests. Also I want to break a bad habit that I have of working on a personal project using all of my spare time, then burning out so that I take a long break from working on personal projects. I am very bad at spending "an hour a night" on something until it is done. Leaving something unfinished until tomorrow. My problem is not that I will cheat and pump out 5 minutes of crap and call it my everyday, but that I will spend 4 hours polishing that turd every night for weeks, on top of my normal programming job, until I don't want to see an IDE for a month. So not only do I want to continue to create and learn, but I want to learn how to do it sustainably.</p>

<p>My rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Work on a personal project every day</li>
    <li>Make a blog entry about it</li>
    <li>Between waking and sleeping</li>
    <li>No minimum time duration</li>
    <li>Learning tools counts</li>
    <li>Streaks are neato, but not the goal</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyday #1: Yesterday I explored my tilde.club account. I decided I did not care for PuTTY so I worked out a better toolchain for SSH on windows, using Windows Terminal, Powershell, and OpenSSH. I learned the basics of weechat. I created a git repo of my home dir and pushed it to github <a href="https://github.com/enamelizer/tilde.club">here</a>.</p>

<p>Everyday #2: Today I figured out how to create a blog using bashblog and created two posts, an introduction and the post you are reading now (I am actually going to be really surprised if someone reads this). I developed my personal rules for my everydays and committed to them live on the internet.</p>

Hi, I'm enamel.
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>I have been thinking of self-hosting a personal site for some time and after a discussion with a friend about getting people together to write silly geocities style web pages, the internet lead me to tilde.club where people were doing just that. I figured doing it as a part of a community effort would be more fun / interesting than going it on my own, so here I am.</p>

<p>In the past I have tried and failed to blog as a part of a professional portfolio, which went nowhere. This time I plan on keeping it light and about personal projects, and keeping posts short.</p>

<p><b>A bit about me.</b> I am a professional software developer in Seattle that specializes in Windows desktop apps. I have been trying to make an effort to explore new technologies (like pubnix) and just generally create more for personal fulfillment. I will post more about the things I have done as I create my homepage, but I generally work on tools, and have been playing around with making music and recently made my first (very very small) game.</p>
